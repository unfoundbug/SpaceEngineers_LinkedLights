======================

Developed by UnFoundBug.

======================

	Linked Lights adds an option to lights which allows them to be turned off/on along with other blocks. 
	
	For example, warning lights which turn on when a welder or grinder is inactive.
	Or mood lighting when reactors are turned on. 

	KNWON ISSUE:
		Sometimes when quick-loading space engineers reports the save as corrupt, this is not actually true, reloading the save allows things to resume. 

======================

V0.0.1: ModAPI Implementation of Linked Lights
	New Supported Lights: Interior Light, Light Panel
