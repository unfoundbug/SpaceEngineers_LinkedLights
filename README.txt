======================

Developed by UnFoundBug.

======================

	Linked Lights adds an option to lights which allows them to be turned off/on along with other blocks. 
	
	For example, warning lights which turn on when a welder or grinder is inactive.
	Or mood lighting when reactors are turned on.
